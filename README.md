A personal website portfolio I created using Bootstrap 4. The goal of this website is to show off any projects I have worked on or am working on. This website was made using Bootstrap 4 JavaScript and CSS that I edited. Most of these changes were to fonts, colors, and sizes. I also had to mess around a lot with the html and body sections of the CSS to make the website responsive on mobile devices. The website also uses GoogleAnalytics to track traffic and FormSpree for the contact page. FormSpree allows for a cleaner look than an old mailTo link. Hosting is done through GitHub Pages.
